\todo[inline]{Expand section} Various forms of convolutional
neural networks are commonly used for text classification. The most classical
architecture is described by \textcite{kim2014conv}, where the input words are
tokenized and embedded before passing them to the convolutional neural network.
\textcite{zhang2015character} show that comparable results can be achieved by
operating on the character-level rather than the word-level.

In terms of analyzing document structure, \textcite{klampfl2014unsupervised}
introduce a method to analyze scientific articles, detecting blocks of text,
labeling them (as e.g. section headers, tables or references) and determining
the reading order --- all in an unsupervised manner. While their approach to
block detection forms an integral part of this thesis, the rest is too
specifically tied to the format of scientific articles to be applicable in this
scenario.
