\chapter{Results}
Todo:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Difference between running with/without clustering data, vary number of clusters
  \item CNN vs RNN, probably conclude that RNNs offer no benefit to compensate
    for the added computational cost
  \item vary stuff like the embedding size and number of filters
  \item add tests on older data
\end{itemize}
