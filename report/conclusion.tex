\section{Conclusion}
Segmenting political proceedings through the use of machine learning is a viable
approach, reaching peak F1 scores of 0.96. When training data is very sparse,
word-level convolutional neural networks are the best option; augmenting them
with information regarding the document layout, whether through K-Means
clustering or an infinite mixture model, offers no notable increase in
performance. When more training data (roughly 1000 positive samples) is
available, character-based convolutional neural networks outperform their
word-based brethren only when augmented using infinite mixture model clustering.
